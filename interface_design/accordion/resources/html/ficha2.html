<p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the styling language that brings life and visual appeal to HTML content. While HTML defines the structure, CSS controls the presentation and layout of web pages.</p>
<p>With CSS, developers can customize the colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design of a website, ensuring a consistent and aesthetically pleasing user experience across different devices. The "cascading" nature of CSS allows styles to be applied hierarchically, providing flexibility and ease of maintenance in the design process.</p>
